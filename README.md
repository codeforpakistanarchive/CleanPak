# CleanPak

This is a community-based volunteer system. 
There are two roles

Inviter and Invitee

Inviter Is the one who takes a picture of any area containing rubbish and posts it.
        Will propose the date and time for the event
        will confirm the event

Invitee Is the one who receives the posts and is asked to join the cleanup mission.
         can also repropose a date and time
         will vote on the desired date in time limit set by Inviter

We have used the Parse API for storing the images and the geopoints. 
Parse Push Notifications have been used to send the Invitee the Posts by the Inviter.
Response has also been sent through Parse Push Notifications.
